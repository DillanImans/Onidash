### Personal Importance
My first ever "big" coding project, all designed and written by myself. This project helped me to practice my javascript and helped me to realize that I'm actually progressing my knowledge. This is also my first ever git commit and github repo. I'm hoping to see this project in the future to look back at my humble beginnings as a developer (and also to cringe at the poorly written code).
